ATTN: I modified the organization of the test/train data by putting ham-spam pairs in the same folder, rather than keeping them in 2 separate subfolders.

Code was implemented in Python 3.10 and run in Visual Studio debugging environment.

discrete.py - Discrete Naive Bayes
multinomial.py - Multinomial Naive Bayes
logistic_reg.py - LR implementation
ML_Project_1.py - SGDClassifier implementation

Packages:
scikit-learn 	1.0.2
numpy 		1.21.5
scipy		1.9.1
pandas		1.4.4

(I was originally using pathlib but running into errors with it, though it's still imported I'm pretty sure it's not accessed but I don't wanna take that off and ruin something right before I submit my work)
